           <p>After many successful years in the mortgage industry focusing on risk management, operations, and pricing analytics, I was laid off when my company relocated to Dallas. Although moving to Dallas would have been a great opportunity, I had local commitments that prevented me from taking the plunge.  At the time I was not sure what I wanted to do and decided to focus on a few of my goals.  As an analyst, I always wanted to learn a scripting language to help automate day-to-day, repetitive tasks.  I was fairly decent at writing macros but wanted a bit more control and “power”.  I enrolled in an online course called Python for Informatics that focused on basics, data structures, web scraping and crawling, and connected to a few APIs.  I had a blast and was hooked! </p>
           <p>Over the next few months, I continued to learn what I could while focusing my efforts on the job search. I knew it would be difficult as there are only a few opportunities in the local area requiring my background and level of experience.  During that timen I kept reminding myself of one consistent theme among the most successful - do what you love and everything else will fall into place. The question for me was what do I love? </p>
           <p>As noted above, I loved learning about Python and discovering what I could do with my new knowledge.  I also enjoyed puzzles and loved doing basic development work for folks in an online forum for a well-known stock trading platform.  The language reminds me of old Pascal from back in the day.  These two passions continued to simmer in the back of my mind along with a long-term goal of learning web development.  Unfortunately, none of this was going to help me land a job, or so I thought. </p>
           <p>On a rainy Friday morning in March 2016, as I was contemplating my place in the universe, I happened to see a commercial for a coding boot camp in my local area.  You would have to know me well to understand the odds of that happening.  I rarely watch TV but when I do I typically ignore most commercials. In the 30 seconds or so while I stood there and watched, I felt like the stars had aligned and the universe was providing an answer.  Boot camp was calling my name. After extensive research I decided to sign up for the upcoming full stack immersive curriculum starting in May.</p>
